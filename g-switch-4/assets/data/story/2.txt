Hello.
I am lost.
Can you help?
#L01
Uhm... Sorry, but I'm pretty
lost myself.
#R03
Oh. That is most unfortunate.
Bzzzzzt-bzzt...
#L01
Who are you?
#R03
I am a ServiceBot, model ZAAK-1006.
I do maintenance repairs.
#L01
OK...
I think I'll just call you Zack.
#R03
That is fine, everyone else does.

I must go. I need to find my friend.
Farewell. Bzzt-bzzzzzt...
#L01
Bye.
