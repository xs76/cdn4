In order to include unknown characters, add this to `fntsml.fnt` as the first character:
```
char id=0       x=5    y=0    width=6    height=9    xoffset=-1   yoffset=-2   xadvance=4    page=0    chnl=0
```

However, this causes problems when moving cursor left/right when typing a message as it also adds the unknown character.
Therefore it is disabled for now.
